Banking Data Analysis using EDA and Power BI
One-line Summary
This project applies Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) and interactive visualization to a comprehensive banking dataset to uncover actionable business insights.

Overview
In this capstone project, I used a multi-stage data pipeline to analyze customer behavior and market trends within a banking dataset. The goal was to transform raw data into a clear narrative using a combination of Python for data exploration and Power BI for creating compelling, interactive dashboards. The final deliverable includes key insights on customer demographics, income drivers, and cross-selling opportunities, providing a foundation for strategic decision-making.

Problem Statement
The modern banking landscape is highly competitive, making a deep understanding of customer behavior essential. This project addresses the challenge of moving beyond raw numbers to derive meaningful patterns and trends. By using a robust analytical approach, the aim was to turn complex data into a clear story that can drive strategic business decisions.

Dataset
The analysis is based on a structured banking dataset that includes a wealth of information on:

Customer demographics

Loan and deposit details

Account information

Customer fee structures

The dataset was sourced from a SQL Server database, and a live connection was established for timely and relevant insights.

Tools and Technologies
SQL Server: Used for housing the raw banking data.

Python: Utilized for data cleaning, preparation, and Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) using libraries such as Pandas, Matplotlib, and Seaborn.

Power BI: Employed to create dynamic and interactive dashboards for data visualization and reporting.
